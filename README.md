# Binomial Distribution Calculator

A simple calculator that uses the **binomial distribution formula**, developed as a Probability course project at **UFFS (Federal University of Fronteira Sul)** – 2025.1.

## 🐍 Requirements

- Python 3.12 (recommended for Ubuntu/Linux users)
- `virtualenv` for creating isolated environments
- Compatible with modern Linux systems (Ubuntu, Debian-based)

> ⚠️ For older Python versions (e.g., Python 3.8 or 3.10), make sure to adjust the `requirements.txt` accordingly if needed.

## 📦 Setup Instructions (Linux/Ubuntu)

### 1. Install `virtualenv` (if not installed)

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
pip install virtualenv

2. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project directory and run:

Always show details

virtualenv venv

You can replace venv with any name you prefer.
3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Always show details

source venv/bin/activate

You should now see the environment name in your terminal prompt, indicating it is active.
🚀 Running the Application

After activating the virtual environment:

Always show details

pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver

📚 About the Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution is a statistical model that describes the probability of achieving a fixed number of successes in a set number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.

This project was developed to assist in understanding and applying this concept in practice.
